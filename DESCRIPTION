Description: Provides an interactive Shiny application for end-to-end Bayesian 
    survival analysis. Features include digitization of Kaplan-Meier curves from 
    published figures, reconstruction of individual patient data (IPD), Bayesian 
    mixture cure model fitting, toxicity and quality-of-life data entry, and 
    final clinical benefit score calculation. Designed to support transparent 
    and reproducible oncology research workflows.
